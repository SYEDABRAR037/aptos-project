ðŸšŒ Bus Attendance Tracking on Aptos
ðŸ“œ Description

This Move smart contract module, BusAttendance, is a decentralized solution for tracking student attendance on school bus routes. It enables route owners to register bus routes and assign drivers, while allowing drivers to record attendance check-ins on-chain, including timestamp, location, and student count.

By leveraging the Aptos blockchain, the module ensures data integrity, transparency, and secure access control â€” drivers can only submit attendance for their assigned routes.

ðŸŒŸ Vision

The vision of this project is to revolutionize traditional attendance tracking in school transportation systems by leveraging blockchain technology. We aim to:

Enhance transparency in attendance records.

Minimize manipulation or falsification of data.

Enable parents and schools to verify attendance history immutably.

Provide a foundation for decentralized school transport management systems.

ðŸš€ Future Scope

This is just the beginning. Planned enhancements for future versions include:

Role-based access control: Integration of roles for admins, school staff, and guardians.

GPS integration: Support for real-time location tracking.

Mobile app interface: A frontend for drivers, schools, and parents to interact with the system.

Multi-route support per driver: Flexibility for drivers to manage multiple routes.

Event logging: Emitting on-chain events for each attendance update to support real-time monitoring.

Student authentication: Individual student check-ins using blockchain wallets or QR codes.
